# Smoothcomp Data Analysis

## Project Overview

Competitive Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has grown from a niche sport into a truly global scene. A huge part of that growth runs through Smoothcomp — a tournament platform that has quietly become one of the largest public records of modern grappling competition.

With more than a decade of event and match data — and new tournaments happening every week — Smoothcomp holds an incredible amount of information. This project explores what that data can tell us about how the sport has evolved and where it might be heading.

## Purpose

Here’s what I’m trying to dig into:

- **How the sport has grown** — match volume over time, participation trends, federation activity, and how the competitive landscape has changed.
- **How performance can be measured** — experimenting with rating systems like ELO (and maybe improving on them), tracking progression, and testing predictive ideas.
- **Upcoming Events** — highlighting upcoming events, interesting matchups, and tournaments with unusually large turnouts.
- **How the data is built and modeled** — documenting the full pipeline from data collection to cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- **And hopefully much more**

Everything here is based on publicly available competition data. I’ve made every effort to include all visible historical records, though some events are excluded due to incomplete results or limited access.
